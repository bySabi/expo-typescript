# expo-typescript

Just a sample hello-world Expo project with:

- Expo SDK >= 31 with React Hook support
- Babel 7
- Typescript@latest
- Jest
- Predefined `tsconfig.json` and `tslint.json`
- `./src` root
- Support for `.android.tsx` and `.ios.tsx`
- Run concurrently `expo start` + `tsc --noEmit` (because babel typescript won't do the typechecking)

Please don't hesitate to contribute or report anything that could be improved, as I'm a TS newbie I probably could have done something wrong.
